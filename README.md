# Simple-Notes-R 🧑‍💻
## It is what? 🤔
Before we get into that, you may check it out [here](https://raccai.github.io/Short-Notes-R/), [here](https://raccai.github.io/Short-Notes-R/), and [here](https://raccai.github.io/Short-Notes-R/). <br /><br />
This is a simple version of a note-creation application with your notes being limited to 150 characters and the title of each note being limited to 30. You may edit each note or delete one when you're done. With experience comes cool functionalities I guess, so I was able to make user information persist in the local browser storage. So, don't worry about losing data if you accidentally close the site!
